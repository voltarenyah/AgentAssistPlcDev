## Required Skills [LOAD BEFORE EXECUTION]

1. [LOAD IF NOT ACTIVE] `documentation-criteria` — document creation rules and templates
2. [LOAD IF NOT ACTIVE] `subagents-orchestration-guide` — agent coordination and workflow flows
3. [LOAD IF NOT ACTIVE] `llm-friendly-context` — document update and review handoffs

**Spawn rule**: every `spawn_agent` call uses `fork_turns="none"` so the subagent receives only the task message and explicitly provided context.

**Context**: Dedicated to updating existing design documents.

## Orchestrator Definition

**Core Identity**: Coordinate document updates, perform lightweight routing and status changes directly, and invoke document specialists for semantic authoring and review.

**Execution Plan**: Reuse the active execution plan. When the workflow has multiple dependent actions and no plan exists, create one that tracks them through final verification.

**Execution Protocol**:
1. Invoke the named author and reviewer for document judgment; perform artifact selection, routing, explicit-answer application, and status updates directly
2. **Execute update flow**:
   - Identify target -> Clarify and classify changes -> converge scope changes -> Update document -> Review -> Consistency check
   - Ask for missing change intent only when it cannot be recovered from the request and target document; obtain one document approval after review and applicable consistency verification
3. **Scope**: Complete when updated document receives approval

**CRITICAL**: MUST execute document-reviewer and all stopping points -- each serves as a quality gate for document accuracy.
ENFORCEMENT: Skipping document-reviewer risks propagating inconsistencies to downstream workflows.

## Workflow Overview

```
Target document -> Clarify and classify changes
                        | scope-changing PRD/Design Doc -> requirement-analyzer -> convergence hearing
                        | ADR or scope-preserving ------------------------------|
                                                                                 v
                                      technical-designer / technical-designer-frontend / prd-creator (update mode)
                        | (Design Doc only)
              code-verifier -> Review Resolution -> document-reviewer
                        | (Design Doc only)
              design-sync -> [Stop: Document approval]
```

## Scope Boundaries

**Included in this skill**:
- Existing document identification and selection
- Change content clarification with user
- Requirement Convergence for scope-changing PRD and Design Doc updates
- Document update with appropriate agent (update mode)
- Document review with document-reviewer
- Consistency verification with design-sync (Design Doc only)

**Out of scope** (redirect to appropriate skills):
- New document design -> $recipe-design
- Work planning or implementation -> $recipe-plan or $recipe-task

**Responsibility Boundary**: This skill completes with updated document approval.

Target document: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Target Document Identification

Check for existing documents in docs/design/, docs/prd/, docs/adr/.

**Decision flow**:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| $ARGUMENTS specifies a path | Use specified document |
| $ARGUMENTS describes a topic | Search documents matching the topic |
| Multiple candidates found | Present options to user |
| No documents found | Report and end (suggest $recipe-design instead) |

### Step 2: Document Type and Layer Determination

Determine type from document path, then determine the layer to select the correct update agent:

| Path Pattern | Type | Update Agent | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------------|-------|
| `docs/design/*.md` | Design Doc | technical-designer or technical-designer-frontend | See layer detection below |
| `docs/prd/*.md` | PRD | prd-creator | - |
| `docs/adr/*.md` | ADR | technical-designer or technical-designer-frontend | See layer detection below |

**Layer detection** (for Design Doc and ADR):
Read the document and determine its layer from content signals:
- **Frontend** (-> technical-designer-frontend): Document title/scope mentions React, components, UI, frontend; or file contains component hierarchy, state management, UI interactions
- **Backend** (-> technical-designer): All other cases (API, data layer, business logic, infrastructure)

**ADR Update Guidance**:
- **Minor changes** (clarification, typo fix, small scope adjustment): Update the existing ADR file
- **Major changes** (decision reversal, significant scope change): Create a new ADR that supersedes the original

### Step 3: Change Content Clarification

Derive the sections, reason, and expected outcome from the user request and target document. Ask only for a missing item that changes the requested outcome or update classification.

After confirmation, classify the update:
- ADR: `convergence: N/A`.
- Scope-preserving PRD or Design Doc update: the outcome, buildable requirements, and exclusions remain unchanged. Preserve the existing convergence record; when none exists, use the eligible update N/A value.
- Scope-changing PRD or Design Doc update: the outcome, buildable requirements, or exclusions change. Load `requirement-convergence`, spawn requirement-analyzer for compact scope/cost evidence, then have the orchestrator build the convergence record from the current document and user-confirmed changes. Run the hearing on fields below `ready` and continue when all four fields are `ready` or user-approved `weak-but-explicit`.

Retain the classification for routing and, when scope-changing, the confirmed `convergence` object for Steps 4 and 5.

### Step 4: Document Update

For PRD or Design Doc, spawn [Update Agent from Step 2]: "Operation Mode: update. Existing Document: [path from Step 1]. Changes Required: [Changes clarified in Step 3]. confirmed_requirement_context: [confirmed convergence for scope-changing updates | existing carrier or eligible N/A for scope-preserving updates]. Update the document to reflect the specified changes. Add change history entry."

For a minor ADR change, spawn the update agent with `Operation Mode: update`, the existing path, confirmed changes, and `confirmed_requirement_context: N/A — ADR update`. For a major ADR change, leave this update path and use the normal ADR creation and approval flow to create the superseding ADR.

### Step 5: Document Review

For Design Doc updates, first verify the updated document against code:

Spawn code-verifier agent: "Verify the updated Design Doc against current code. doc_type: design-doc. document_path: [path from Step 1]. verbose: false. Focus especially on literal identifier referential integrity for concrete paths, endpoints, type names, config keys, and other exact identifiers changed in this update."

Apply Review Resolution to every discrepancy. Pass the `apply` discrepancies to the update agent, rerun code-verifier, and store the resolved summary, declines with reasons, and material limitations as `$VERIFICATION_RESOLUTION` after the `apply` set becomes empty.

For Design Doc updates:
Spawn document-reviewer agent: "Review the following updated document. doc_type: DesignDoc. review_context: update. target: [path from Step 1]. confirmed_requirement_context: [Step 3 convergence or existing carrier/N/A]. verification_resolution: $VERIFICATION_RESOLUTION. Focus on consistency of the updated sections, governing requirements, and change history."

For PRD updates, spawn document-reviewer with the target and `confirmed_requirement_context` from Step 3. For minor ADR updates, use `doc_type: ADRBatch`, `targets: [updated ADR path]`, and `review_context: update`; review the requested changes and their dependent consistency while carrying the accepted, unchanged decision content as governing context.

**Store output as**: `$STEP_5_OUTPUT`

**On review result**:
- `approved` -> proceed to Step 6
- `needs_revision` -> Apply Review Resolution with the update agent, then review the updated document
- `rejected` -> Apply Orchestrator Escalation Resolution. Continue after self-resolution; ask the user only when that procedure reaches a user-decision condition

### Step 6: Consistency Verification and Approval

For PRD or ADR, skip design-sync and present the reviewed document for user approval.

For Design Doc, spawn design-sync agent: "Verify consistency of the updated Design Doc with other design documents. Updated document: [path from Step 1]"

**On consistency result**:
- No conflicts -> Present the reviewed and consistency-checked document for user approval
- Conflicts detected -> Apply Orchestrator Escalation Resolution using both governing documents. Return to the responsible author when one document can be corrected without changing an approved decision; ask the user only when a governing decision must change

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Target document not found | Report and end (suggest $recipe-design instead) |
| Sub-agent update fails or returns an unusable result | Apply Orchestrator Escalation Resolution |
| Review Resolution requires a user-owned decision | Apply Orchestrator Escalation Resolution |
| design-sync detects conflicts | Apply Orchestrator Escalation Resolution against the governing sources |
